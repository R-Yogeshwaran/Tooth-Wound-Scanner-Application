# Tooth-Wound-Scanner-Application

Overview : 

This React Native mobile application is designed to help users identify the source of a bite wound. By capturing an image of the wound using the built-in scanner, the application utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze the image and determine which animal caused the bite. This project leverages the power of mobile technology combined with machine learning to provide a valuable tool for medical professionals and individuals alike.

Features :

Image Capture: Allows users to take a clear image of the bite wound using the device's camera.

Machine Learning Analysis: Processes the captured image through a trained machine learning model to identify the animal responsible for the bite.

User-Friendly Interface: Designed with a simple and intuitive interface to ensure ease of use, even in urgent situations.

Technology Stack :

React Native: Provides a cross-platform mobile development framework, enabling the app to run on both iOS and Android devices.

Machine Learning: Utilizes a pre-trained model to analyze wound images and classify the animal bite.

Scanner Integration: Integrates with the device's camera to capture high-quality images for analysis.
